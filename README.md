# fetch

A donut.c-inspired fetch tool that spins your distro logo in 3D with live-updating system info.

![demo](demo.gif)

Takes any ASCII/Unicode distro logo, turns each character into a point cloud
based on its visual density, and renders it as a rotating 3D relief with
Blinn-Phong shading. System info is gathered natively — no external
dependencies required. Works on Linux and macOS.

Based on [gentoo.c](https://github.com/areofyl/gentoo.c).

## Build & run

```
make
./fetch
```

Press any key to stop — the keypress passes through to the shell, so it
works as a startup fetch. Ctrl-C works too.

## Install

```
sudo make install
```

`PREFIX=~/.local make install` if you don't want it system-wide.

<summary><h2>Package managers</h2></summary>

### Arch Linux (AUR)
You can install `fetch-git` from the AUR using your favorite AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S fetch-git
```
or
```bash
paru -S fetch-git
```

The `fetch-git` AUR package was not compromised in the AUR package hack. It is maintained and up to date.

### Nix
Fetch is available in **[nixpkgs unstable](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&query=fetch#show=fetch)**, or as a [flake](https://github.com/areofyl/fetch/tree/main/nix).

**Try out fetch!**
```
nix-shell -p fetch
```

Add to your ```configuration.nix``` or ```home.nix```.

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  ...
  pkgs.fetch
  ...
];
```

### Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew tap areofyl/fetch
brew install fetch-git
```

### Fedora Linux
You can install `fetch` from COPR:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable realorangekun/fetch
sudo dnf install fetch
```

Or build an RPM package locally:

```bash
sudo dnf install @development-tools
rpmbuild -ba fetch.spec
sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/*/fetch-*.rpm
```

### openSUSE
You can install `fetch` from the Open Build Service:

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:RealOrangeKun/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:RealOrangeKun.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install fetch
```

Or build an RPM package locally:

```bash
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
rpmbuild -ba fetch.spec
sudo zypper install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/*/fetch-*.rpm
```

### Ubuntu / Debian
You can install `fetch` from the PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:realorangekun/fetch
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fetch
```

Or build a `.deb` package locally:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b
sudo apt install ../fetch_*.deb
```

### Gentoo Linux (GURU)
You can install `fetch` from the GURU repository using:

```bash
eselect repository enable guru
emaint sync -r guru
emerge -a app-misc/fetch
```

As for all GURU packages, you will have to add the package in your `package.accept\_keywords` directory if `~arch` is not already set.

## Logos

By default it auto-detects your distro and grabs the logo from fastfetch
(if installed) with its original per-character colors preserved. Works with
any of fastfetch's 500+ distro logos!

You can also specify one directly:

```
./fetch -l arch
./fetch -l NixOS
./fetch -l asahi
```

Or drop a custom logo in `~/.config/fetch/logo.txt`:

```
# distro: gentoo
         -/oyddmdhs+:.
     -odNMMMMMMMMNNmhy+-`
...
```

Without fastfetch, the built-in Gentoo logo is used.

## System info

All system info is gathered natively — no fastfetch or neofetch needed:

- **OS** - `/etc/os-release`
- **Host** - `/proc/device-tree/model` or `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name`
- **Kernel** - `uname()`
- **Uptime** - `/proc/uptime`
- **Packages** - emerge, pacman, dpkg, rpm, xbps, apk
- **Shell** - parent process detection (not just `$SHELL`)
- **Display** - per-connector DRM enumeration (multi-monitor)
- **WM** - process scanning + DE-to-WM mapping
- **Theme/Icons/Font** - `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` (Linux), `defaults read` (macOS)
- **CPU** - `/proc/cpuinfo`, device-tree (Apple Silicon), or `sysctl` (macOS)
- **GPU** - DRM + `lspci` for full names (Linux), `system_profiler` (macOS)
- **Memory/Swap** - `/proc/meminfo` (Linux), `vm_stat` (macOS)
- **Disk** - `statvfs()` + `/proc/mounts` (Linux), `getmntinfo` (macOS)
- **Battery** - `energy_now/energy_full` (Linux), IOKit (macOS)
- **Packages** - emerge, pacman, dpkg, rpm/dnf, xbps, apk, flatpak, brew
- **Local IP** - `getifaddrs()`

Stats like memory, battery, and uptime update in real-time while the logo spins.

# appearance
# label_color=magenta   (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white)
# separator=─           (character for the title separator)
# shading=.,-~:;=!*#$@  (characters for 3D shading, supports UTF-8)
# box=0                 (adds a box around the system-data, 0 = off, 1 = on)

# logo colors (override distro defaults)
# logo_outer=magenta    (outer/heavy character color)
# logo_inner=white      (inner/light character color)

# 3d
# light=top-left        (top-left, top-right, top, left, right, front, bottom-left, bottom-right)
# spin=xy               (x, y, or xy)
# speed=1.0             (rotation speed)
# size=1.0              (logo scale, e.g. 2.0 for double size)
# depth=1.0             (3D extrusion depth, e.g. 3.0 for chunkier look)
# height=36             (override render height in rows)
```

## Options

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or package fetch for
your distro, go for it. I try to keep the codebase small and easy to understand,
so smaller PRs are easier to merge than big ones.

If you want to chat about ideas before writing code, reach out on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/areofyl) or open an issue.

## How it works

Each character in the logo gets a weight based on its visual density (`M` is
heavy, `.` is light, `█` is full, `░` is thin), and that weight becomes a height,
turning the flat logo into a 3D relief. Surface normals come from the height
gradient, and everything gets rotated + projected + shaded every frame with a
z-buffer. Single file C, no deps beyond libm.
