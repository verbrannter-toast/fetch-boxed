# fetch

A donut.c-inspired fetch tool that spins your distro logo in 3D with live-updating system info.

![demo](demo.gif)

Takes any ASCII/Unicode distro logo, turns each character into a point cloud
based on its visual density, and renders it as a rotating 3D relief with
Blinn-Phong shading. System info is gathered natively from `/proc`, `/sys`,
and GTK config — no external dependencies required.

Based on [gentoo.c](https://github.com/areofyl/gentoo.c).

## Build & run

```
make
./fetch
```

Press any key to stop — the keypress passes through to the shell, so it
works as a startup fetch. Ctrl-C works too.

## Install

```
sudo make install
```

`PREFIX=~/.local make install` if you don't want it system-wide.

### Arch Linux (AUR)
You can install `fetch-git` from the AUR using your favorite AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S fetch-git
```
or
```bash
paru -S fetch-git
```

The `fetch-git` AUR package was not compromised in the AUR package hack. It is maintained and up to date.

### Nix Flake
Add this repo to your ```flake.nix```. The package is built using the unstable channel. You can overwrite this by setting ```inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"``` (if your default is 25.11).

```nix
inputs = {
  ...
areofyl-fetch.url = "github:areofyl/fetch";
  ...
}
```

#### Home-manager
You also need to import the nix package in your ```home.nix```. Check ```nix/home-module.nix``` for the options. Most are the same but hyphens can not be used so camel-case has been used for those options instead.

```nix
{ pkgs, inputs, ... }: 

{
  imports = [ inputs.areofyl-fetch.homeManagerModules.default ];
  
  programs.fetch = {
    enable = true;
    labelColor = "red";
    info = [];
    speed = 1.0;
    spin = "xy";
  };
  
}
```

### Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew tap areofyl/fetch
brew install fetch-git
```

### Gentoo Linux (GURU)
You can install `fetch` from the GURU repository using:

```bash
eselect repository enable guru
emaint sync -r guru
emerge -a app-misc/fetch
```

As for all GURU packages, you will have to add the package in your `package.accept\_keywords` directory if `~arch` is not already set.

## Logos

By default it auto-detects your distro and grabs the logo from fastfetch
(if installed) with its original per-character colors preserved. Works with
any of fastfetch's 500+ distro logos!

You can also specify one directly:

```
./fetch -l arch
./fetch -l NixOS
./fetch -l asahi
```

Or drop a custom logo in `~/.config/fetch/logo.txt`:

```
# distro: gentoo
         -/oyddmdhs+:.
     -odNMMMMMMMMNNmhy+-`
...
```

Without fastfetch, the built-in Gentoo logo is used.

## System info

All system info is gathered natively — no fastfetch or neofetch needed:

- **OS** — `/etc/os-release`
- **Host** — `/proc/device-tree/model` or `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name`
- **Kernel** — `uname()`
- **Uptime** — `/proc/uptime`
- **Packages** — emerge, pacman, dpkg, rpm, xbps, apk
- **Shell** — `$SHELL` + version
- **Display** — `/sys/class/drm/card*/modes`
- **WM** — env vars + process detection
- **Theme/Icons/Font** — `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`
- **CPU** — `/proc/cpuinfo` or device-tree (Apple Silicon)
- **GPU** — DRM device uevent
- **Memory/Swap** — `/proc/meminfo`
- **Disk** — `statvfs()`
- **Battery** — `/sys/class/power_supply` (energy_now/energy_full)
- **Local IP** — `ip addr`

Stats like memory, battery, and uptime update in real-time while the logo spins.

## Config

Create `~/.config/fetch/config` to customize:

```
# fields — list to show, in this order
# remove or comment out to hide
os
host
kernel
uptime
packages
shell
display
wm
theme
icons
font
terminal
cpu
gpu
memory
swap
disk
ip
battery
locale
colors

# appearance
# label_color=magenta   (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white)
# separator=─           (character for the title separator)
# shading=.,-~:;=!*#$@  (characters for 3D shading, supports UTF-8)

# 3d
# light=top-left        (top-left, top-right, top, left, right, front, bottom-left, bottom-right)
# spin=xy               (x, y, or xy)
# speed=1.0             (rotation speed)
# size=1.0              (logo scale, e.g. 2.0 for double size)
# height=36             (override render height in rows)
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-l`, `--logo <name>` | Use a logo from fastfetch by name |
| `--rotate-x` | Lock rotation to X axis only |
| `--rotate-y` | Lock rotation to Y axis only |
| `-s`, `--speed <float>` | Speed multiplier (default 1.0) |
| `--size <float>` | Scale the logo (e.g. 2.0 for double size) |
| `--height <n>` | Override render height in rows |
| `--no-info` | Just the logo, no system info |
| `--no-color` | Disable coloring |
| `--frames <n>` | Stop after n frames |
| `--infinite` | Run forever |
| `--shading-chars <str>` | Custom shading ramp, supports UTF-8 |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

CLI flags override config file settings.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or package fetch for
your distro, go for it. I try to keep the codebase small and easy to understand,
so smaller PRs are easier to merge than big ones.

If you want to chat about ideas before writing code, reach out on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/areofyl) or open an issue.

## How it works

Each character in the logo gets a weight based on its visual density — `M` is
heavy, `.` is light, `█` is full, `░` is thin. That weight becomes a height,
turning the flat logo into a 3D relief. Surface normals come from the height
gradient, and everything gets rotated + projected + shaded every frame with a
z-buffer. Single file C, no deps beyond libm.
